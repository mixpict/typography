<p>Conclusion • concurrent dna may be achieved on both the leading and lagging strand at a single replication fork. Department of health and human services. Forth, lagging strand synthesis is mechanistically more complica ted than leading strand synthesis, implying that the sophisticated machinery for this process may come across ac cidents in many. The key difference between lagging and leading strand is that the synthesis of lagging strand is discontinuous and it occurs in the direction opposite to the growing replication fork while the synthesis of leading strand is continuous and it occurs in the same direction as the growing replication fork.</p>

<p>This strand is called the lagging strand. Leading strand refers to one of two strands of dna found at the replication fork, being replicated continuously while lagging strand refers to the other strand found at the replication fork, replicating discontinuously in the 5′ to 3′ direction. The lagging strand, on the other hand, is. The synthesis of leading strand is continuous. Leading Vs Lagging Strand.</p>
