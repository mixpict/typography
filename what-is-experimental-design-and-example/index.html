Figure 8.1 steps in classic experimental design. In one portion of this multifaceted study, all participants were given a pretest to assess their levels of depression. The most basic example of experimental research is laboratory experiments, which may differ in nature depending on the subject of research. This includes details such as a hypothesis, treatments and controls that allow others to evaluate your experiment or replicate it.

<p>An experiment design is a plan to execute an experiment. You must follow these five steps to creating an effective experimental design: A good experimental design requires a strong understanding of the system you are studying. Experimental design is an efficient method of optimizing the experimental conditions for spe to maximize the amount of useful information obtained with the minimum number of experiments.
