<p>The experimental features in geforce experience offers a lot of really awesome things. When we activate them, what the tool does is download the new version from the company’s servers and install it on top of the one we already have. When you download the driver it will give you the option to only install the driver or install the full experience. The good thing about geforce experience’s experimental features is that they can be easily enabled and disabled at your leisure.</p>
