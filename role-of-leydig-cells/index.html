<p>Leydig cells often display cytoplasmic. These are present in the testes within small compartments known as testicular lobules. Somatic cells, including leydig cells, myoid cells, and sertoli cells, constitute the microenvironment or the niche of testis, which is essential for regulating normal spermatogenesis. Leydig cells secrete paracrine factors that help to balance the function of sertoli cells, which helps in the generation of germ cells and plays an important role in spermatogenesis.
