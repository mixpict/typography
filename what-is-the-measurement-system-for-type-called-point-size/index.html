<p>If the size of objects is represented, then such a measure is called a size dimension; Points are understood and used extensively by everyone in the publishing trade, particularly in design, typesetting, and printing. It’s not the most com­fort­able size for read­ing. Since each size of a typeface had to be cut individually, point size was determined by the distance from the height of the tallest ascender to the tip of the longest.
