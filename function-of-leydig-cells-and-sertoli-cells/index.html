Sertoli cell only syndrome causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment From healthjade.net
What is the function of leydig cells? • they provide nutrition to the developing sperms during spermatogenesis therefore, the sertoli cells are also named as ‘mother or nurse cell’. It is the part of a seminiferous tubule and it helps in the process of spermatogenesis i.e. Sertoli cells are stimulated by fsh, whereas leydig cells are stimulated by lh.

Leydig cells are interstitial cells located adjacent to the seminiferous tubules in the testes. The results suggest that hypercholesterolaemia has a detrimental effect on leydig and sertoli cell secretory function, spermatogenesis, epididymal sperm maturation process, and the overall sperm fertilizing capacity. The leydig cells, also located in the testes, release a male sex hormone called testosterone.in men, some cancers of the testes can start in the sertoli and leydig cells. Pin su physiology.</p>

This neglect is all the more remarkable when it is considered that fertility is critically dependent on the link between sertoli and leydig cells, in that spermatogenesis is regulated by the sertoli cell only under the driving influence of testosterone from the leydig cells (hansson et al., 1978; The major role of leydig’s cells is to produce testosterone, whereas sertoli cells have a major function in support.

<p>Why is a single ovum produced by oogenesis? The reciprocal influence between leydig and sertoli cells prepared from pig testis were studied by coculture of both types of cells in either plastic dishes or dishes coated with basement membrane matrix.
