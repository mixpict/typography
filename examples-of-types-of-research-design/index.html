<p>A qualitative is different from a quantitative research design. The main purpose of research designs is to guide you in terms of analyzing various complex models and articulating new procedures for conducting any types of research fields like in social science research. Some research requires samples to have specific characteristics, for example, targeting a specific social group. The first set serves as a constant against which the variations in the second set are measured. PPT Kinds of Research Design PowerPoint Presentation, free download.</p>
