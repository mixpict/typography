This is how the iterative methodology works. The process of advancing the quality of a work product by creating many versions of it with the goal of improving with each version. By making small, progressive developments, designers are able to create the most viable version with minimal waste. Instead, iterative design is designed to produce failure as often as possible, since failure gives designers valuable feedback about what needs fixing.
