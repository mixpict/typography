<p>The rock cycle is a concept used to explain how the three basic rock types are related and how earth processes, over geologic time, change a rock from one type into another. Rock is an aggregation of different minerals. Igneous rock can be metamorphosed directly into metamorphic rock, and metamorphic rock can turn directly to sediment.
