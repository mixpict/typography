Layout design rules describe how small features can be &amp; how closely they can be packed in a manufacturing process. These patterns are designed with regard to a class&#39;s structure and composition. Layout design is a schematic of the integrated circuit (ic) which describes the exact placement of the components for fabrication. Approach design as a communication process.
