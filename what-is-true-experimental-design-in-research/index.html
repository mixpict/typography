Experimental design is the process of carrying out research in an objective and controlled fashion so that precision is maximized and specific conclusions can be drawn regarding a hypothesis statement. Randomization and the comparison of both a control and an experimental group are utilized in this type of study.

<p>A true experimental design is one in which the researcher manipulates the independent variable (or variables) to observe its effect on some behavior or cognitive process (the dependent variable) while using random assignment of participants to groups in order to control external factors from influencing the results. The researcher develops the experiment to test a hypothesis. Experimental research design is an elegant way to find out how well a particular program achieves its goals. Some of the vital factors that need to be satisfied in this method include random variables, easily managed variables by. True Experimental Research Design Example Images Gallery.</p>
