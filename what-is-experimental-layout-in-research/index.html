Experimental design diagram (edd) is a diagram used in science classrooms to design an experiment.this diagram helps to identify the essential components of an experiment. For this purpose there is the need of proper layout of the report. In steps 1 through 3, you wrote out your research question and objective, developed a hypothesis, and figured out what you will observe and measure in the field. For this purpose there is the need of proper layout of the report.

<p>Where the experimental units are fairly homogeneous, and the environmental conditions within the physical space of the experiment are uniform. Experimental research designs are concerned with the examination of the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable, where the independent variable is manipulated through treatment. Experimental research is a quantitative research method with a scientific approach, where a set of variables are kept constant while the other set of variables are being measured as the subject of an experiment. The first set of variables, known as the independent variables, are manipulated by the researcher, in order to determine the impact on the second set of variablesâthe dependent variables.

Experimental research is a quantitative research method with a scientific approach, where a set of variables are kept constant while the other set of variables are being measured as the subject of an experiment.

<p>In steps 1 through 3, you wrote out your research question and objective, developed a hypothesis, and figured out what you will observe and measure in the field. The first set of variables, known as the independent variables, are manipulated by the researcher, in order to determine the impact on the second set of variablesâthe dependent variables.
