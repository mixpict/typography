Statistics draw conclusions about very large groups of individuals (animate or inanimate), when we can only study small groups of them. Ø all other factors are applied uniformly to all plots. In this section we describe the most commonly used research designs and discuss the major issues that govern the choice of design. Such questions of layout should not be decided arbitrarily.

<p>The type of statistical method that will be used to analyze data will depend on the experimental design, therefore the specific questions that the experiment is intended to answer must be clearly identified before carrying out the experiment. This means that the sample of individuals being studied must be representative, in sufficient quantities, and we must also state.

By an experiment we understand an investigation where the researcher has full control over selecting and altering the experimental conditions of interest, and we only consider investigations of this type. It is wise to take time and effort to organize the experiment properly to ensure that the right type of data, and enough of it, is available to answer the questions of interest as clearly and efficiently as possible.
