These design approaches fall into two categories: “it consists of merging ,integrating ,linking ,or embedding the two “strands”” (ceswell,2012). Different strategies to present prototypes of ways to design a mixed method study is a topic that has received considerable attention in the literature in the field. The subsequent sections review the three basic types of mixed methods designs in more detail.

<p>The sixth type, the multiphase mixed methods designs, is used when researchers or a team of researchers examine a problem or topic through a series of phases or separate studies (figure 6). (1) this is a design that includes both qual and quan data collection and analysis in parallel form (concurrent mixed method design, in which two types of data are collected and analyzed), in sequential form (sequential mixed method design, in which one type of data provides a basis for collection of another type of data.
