Inventor Large Assembly Drawing Performance TOO SLOW From forums.autodesk.com
Move the cursor over a line or arc you suspect that has multiple geometry. On the ribbon click sketch tab format panel sketch only to turn on the attribute. Each part (.ipt) can have its standalone drawing (.idw/.dwg) file as well. So typically patent drawings must be filed for nearly every patent application.
