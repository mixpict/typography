<p>A twist drill is very inefficient at the point because the web leaves scant exit space for debris (called swarf) and because the point has a low surface speed compared to the periphery. Because the heat treatment and subsequent grinding process are basically the same, the main difference is the twist drill part of the work of the forming process. This converts to less drilling time and physical exertion. However, for environments that require better chip removal and higher strength of cutting edge, the drill with a smaller helix angle can be selected. Wood vs. Metal Drill Bits.
