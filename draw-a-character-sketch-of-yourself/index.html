For example, for your character‚Äôs shirt, draw the sleeves over their arms and the body of the shirt over their torso. A character sketch gives a complete view of yourself and we can change ourselves if there are any negatives that we have because while writing a character sketch we need to be true to ourselves so that we are cheating our own inner self because then only you change yourself and become a better person otherwise you will stay were you are and will never be able to grow in life. Bholi was a simple, but sensitive girl. &#39;speed lines&#39; and &#39;focus lines&#39; make it look like your character is in motion.
