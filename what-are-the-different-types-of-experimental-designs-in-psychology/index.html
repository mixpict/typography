Experimental research is designed to assess cause and effect. In this type of experimental study, only one dependent group or variable is considered. Random assignment is a method for assigning participants in a sample to the different conditions, and it is an important element of all experimental research in psychology and other fields too. One is that each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to each condition.
