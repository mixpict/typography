<p>The loop is the most common fingerprint pattern all over the world. There are different types of fingerprint readers on the market, but the basic idea behind each is to measure the physical difference between ridges and valleys. It is patterned in a way that ridges run from one side of the fingertip to the other side of the fingertip without making any backward turn. Any calculation of probability that 2 prints could match and not be from the same person is usually made with gross simplifications, but there are an astronomical number of combinations.</p>
