4.5 urban areas can have primary activities The rectangular or block pattern of the road is normally considered as unsafe as the vehicles meet in the opposite direction at the intersections. As in other, a radial network of road radiates from the centre outwardly. The rectangular/ block/ grid pattern is a plan where the streets and roads are in the form of grids or blocks running perpendicularly into each other thus forming a grid or block.
