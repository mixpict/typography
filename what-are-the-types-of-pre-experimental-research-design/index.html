<p>In doing this, the researcher attempts to determine or predict what may occur. A group, or various groups, are kept under observation after implementing factors of cause and effect. It is a systematic plan of what is to be done, how it will be done, how the data will be analyzed. In this type of research design, researcher selects two similar groups from the target population, one is called 'experimental group' and the other is 'control group'.

<p>Case report or case series; The types of experimental research design are determined by the way the researcher assigns subjects to different conditions and groups. A group, or several groups of people, are kept under observation after factors with cause and effect are considered. The way you classify research subjects, based on conditions or groups, determines the type of research design you should use. Experimental research design.</p>
