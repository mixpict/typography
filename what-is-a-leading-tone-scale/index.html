<p>The whole tone scale has a distinctly recognizable sound. The natural minor scale is ever so slightly different though as the 7th degree of the scale is an interval of a tone (whole step) below the tonic instead of a semitone (half step) like the leading note. The whole tone scale is in contrast to the chromatic scale, which is the collection of all 12 half tones (no whole tones) or diatonic scales, which are built with a mixture of whole tones and half tones. For this reason a flattened 7th note is called the subtonic. 3 Strategies to Produce Strong Chord Resolutions&hellip; Creative Guitar.</p>
