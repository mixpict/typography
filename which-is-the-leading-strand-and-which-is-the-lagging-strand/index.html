<li>leading strand synthesis happens in the direction of replication fork opening, whereas lagging strand synthesis happens in the opposite direction. The leading strand and lagging strand are the two strands at the replication fork, which serve as the templates for dna replication. The major difference between a lagging and leading strand is that the lagging strand replicates discontinuously forming short fragments, whereas the leading strand replicates continuously.

<p>And this is gonna be really important for understanding replication, because the dna polymerase, the things that's adding more and more nucleotides to grow a dna strand; ““the lagging strand polymerase synthesizes dna faster than the leading strand polymerase.”” dna replication occurs at the replication fork, which forms when dna is unwound by a helicase into strands that are copied by two polymerases into a leading strand and a lagging strand. Here's a little bit of info in regards to dna synthesis and the difference between leading/lagging strand! The major difference between a lagging and leading strand is that the lagging strand replicates discontinuously forming short fragments, whereas the leading strand replicates continuously.
