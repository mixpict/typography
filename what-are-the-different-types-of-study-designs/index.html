<p>Creating a research design means making decisions about: Your overall aims and approach. Before delving into understanding the different types of study designs, let’s get familiarized with the commonly used terminologies that are used when choosing the right design. For instance, researchers may want to know what scientific knowledge is available on a certain subject, like the effect of pet ownership on anxiety levels.
