Factorial design charts for the effect of interaction between the two From researchgate.net
We can also depict a factorial design in design notation. In this episode i show how you could set up a two factor research design using an interesting topic: Factorial designs are used to examine multiple independent variables while other studies have singular independent or dependent variables. In a factorial research design, the main effect is an important feature to consider.

<p>A factor is an independent variable in the experiment and a level is a subdivision of a. But for the experiments involving a higher number of variables, factorial design is generally a good and efficient experimental approach. Share button factorial design an experimental study in which two or more categorical variables are simultaneously manipulated or observed in order to study their joint influence (interaction effect) and separate influences (main effects) on a separate dependent variable.for example, a researcher could use a factorial design to investigate treatment type (e.g., new exercise. The way in which a scientific experiment is set up is called a design.</p>
