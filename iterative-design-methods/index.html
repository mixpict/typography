<p>A linear process may automatically insist upon the idea of a straightforward and organized procedure. The ethos behind an iterative design process is that you can improve your design with each iteration rather than aim for a perfect design with one single pass.

<p>For example, agile and scrum methodologies are based on an iterative and incremental approach. Instead of incremental design where you start small and build until a final product is made, iterative design means your product is never truly finished.

The goal of iteration is to get closer to the optimal solution with each repetition. Itâs simply a series of steps that you repeat, tweaking and improving your product with each new cycle. This means that once you iron out one stage, the next one commences.</p>
