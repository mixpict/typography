Leydig cells are an important component. Function of leydig cells it synthesises and secrete hormones androgens, e.g. The main function of leydig cells is to synthesize a group of testicular hormones known as androgens which are responsible. Testosterone secreted by fetal leydig cells is required for the differentiation of the male urogenital system late in gestation (huhtaniemi and pelliniemi, 1992).
