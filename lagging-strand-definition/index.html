A lagging strand requires a slight delay before undergoing replication, and it must undergo. Biology glossary search by everythingbio.com in dna replication, the strand that is synthesized apparently in the 3&#39; to 5&#39; direction, but actually in the 5&#39; to 3&#39; direction by ligating short fragments synthesized individually. Due to the functional restriction of the dna polymerase not being able to synthesize the chain in 3’ to 5’ direction, on the lagging strand, the synthesis of the chain is discontinuous. The lagging strand is the dna strand replicated in the 3&#39; to 5&#39; direction during dna replication from a template strand.

Whereas, the lagging strand as the name suggests, it lags behind and is always very slowly synthesized in the form of various small fragments on the. Dna replication is the process of amplifying the dna to get identical copies. The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5’ to 3’ direction, working towards the fork direction with removal of the rna primers as the parental duplex is unwound.

A lagging strand is one of two strands of dna found at the replication fork, or junction, in the double helix; Chapter 16.</p>

The  lagging strand  is synthesized in the direction away from the replication fork and away from the dna helicase unwinds. Thus, this is the main difference between leading and lagging strand.
