Experimental design in the social sciences, are studies that randomly assign subjects (i.e., program participants) to treatment and control groups, then measure changes (i.e., average changes) in both groups to determine if a program, or “treatment,” has had a desired effect on those who receive the treatment. Engaging, informative, and nontechnical, introduction to educational research: You can choose to increase air. Experimental research design is a rigorous approach to studying various subjects, including life science, physical sciences, and social sciences.
