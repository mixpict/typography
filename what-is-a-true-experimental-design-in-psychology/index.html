How To Write An Experimental Design Paragraph From tbseas.blogspot.com
Random sampling is a method for selecting a sample from a population, and it is rarely used in psychological research. A true experimental design is one in which the researcher manipulates the independent variable (or variables) to observe its effect on some behavior or cognitive process (the dependent variable) while using random assignment of participants to groups in order to control external factors from influencing the results. An attempt to control the effects of order in a repeated measures design: True experimental design is regarded as the most accurate form of experimental research, in that it tries to prove or disprove a hypothesis mathematically, with statistical analysis.
