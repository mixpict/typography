Sketchup runs great for the most part, but its getting to the point where layout is unusable due to its slow speed and response time. I find that selecting or command selecting items within groups is very slow and shows a longer spinner at zoom levels of 100% vs 25% for example. This pointless file has 4000 copies of one component, is 1,003,082 bytes and with profiles on takes 2 or 3 seconds to display the profile edges.

<p>Been using sketchup and layout for the last 3 or 4 years or so. Purge all your layers into one. But i have a few tips on how you can optimize your sketchup file for best viewing experience: The export quality from layout is very high, even set to low.</p>

<p>Modelo renders your model by layer, meaning each additional layer will. But now layout is ridiculously slow. I am thinking that simplifying the sketch as much as i can will help it run faster.

<p>You could have a 1mb file with thousands of copies of one component that would slow sketchup down a lot. Modelo renders your model by layer, meaning each additional layer will. I have the large assembly mode turned on and image quality turned as low. However, this is very slow, and i seems to update, when i resize the window. Draw It Too Drawings YouTube.</p>

<p>You could have a 1mb file with thousands of copies of one component that would slow sketchup down a lot. The drawing is some lines arcs and a long spline with many points. The limit would depend on your hardware and how patient you are to put up with waiting. I was just following along with the information on the arduino site for new users.

<p>I have the large assembly mode turned on and image quality turned as low. Im working on an assembly drawing. For most of my drawings, i export low and uncheck layers.

<p>Recently i was dealing a solidworks slow performance issue on a new machine. It takes forever to resize viewports and to move them. As the title says, snip&amp;sketch has for some reason added a lot of delay between me pressing the key combo and it taking the picture on the screen, it worked just fine in win1903 but i updated to 2004 and it takes it's time for it, so i can't get the picture just when i want to because of this delay.

While a performance improvement at this zoom level, it becomes very difficult to design well or with pixel perfection (too many compromises for a primary tool).

My sketch also has classes, superclasses, and subclasses, as well as pvectors and keyboard interaction, which may contribute to the slowness.

While a performance improvement at this zoom level, it becomes very difficult to design well or with pixel perfection (too many compromises for a primary tool).
