What Does Low Cholesterol Mean? From livestrong.com
Low trac means your on board computer sensed wheel slip and engaged the traction control system so the vehicle does not skid or slide. I have not had the chance to drive it on a icy/wet road yet, so this has only been happening on dry, normal. The trac off and vsc off indicator. Low traction means there is a lack of surface friction to keep your tires in sufficient contact with the paving surface to prevent slippage.
