What Is Grid Computing? Savvy Tower From savvytower.com
Think of each computing system or node in a grid as the member of a team that the software is leading. Grid computing is a distributed architecture of large numbers of computers connected to solve a complex problem. In general, grid computing is divided into two subtypes, i.e., data grid and computational grid.data grids provide controlled sharing and management. The concept of grid computing was created in the late 1990s by researchers at argonne national labs and other places.
