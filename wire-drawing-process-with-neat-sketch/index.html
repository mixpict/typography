<p>Wire drawing â¢ wire drawing involves reducing the diameter of a rod or wire by passing through a series of drawing dies or plates. Forging is the plastic, or permanent, changing of a metal shape. The process of wire drawing changes material properties due to cold working. The rolling process is a metal forming process, in which stock of the material is passed between one or more pairs of rollers in order to reduce and to maintain the uniform thickness.

<p>Thus, the difference between drawing and extrusion is that in extrusion the material is pushed through a die, whereas in drawing it is pulled through it. The exact die sequence for a particular job is a function of area reduction, input wire size and output wire size. For the primary sheet metal deep drawing process the part will have a flat base and straight sides. The position of mandrel may be adjusted by the bar attached to its rear end in order to change the thickness of tube and the internal diameter.

<p>This process involves reducing diameter of thick wire by passing it through a series of wire drawing dies with successive die having smaller diameter than the preceding one. The area reduction in small wires is generally 15 % to 25 % and in larger wires is 20 % to 45 %. The position of mandrel may be adjusted by the bar attached to its rear end in order to change the thickness of tube and the internal diameter. Drawing of wires is usually accomplished using single or multiple drafts as shown in figures below: Lathe machines Diagram and pics GTU Express.</p>

<p>Mechanics of deep drawing 3. The manufacturing of deep, cuplike products from thin sheet metal is known as deep drawing. The punch is the desired shape of the base of the part, once drawn. It is a severe deformation process resulting in massive shape change. Concepts of rolling, annealing, quenching, drawing, cold.</p>
